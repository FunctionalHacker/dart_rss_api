# Dart RSS API
This library aims to support both the gReader and fever API's. I use [FreshRSS](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS) myself so this is what I'm testing against.

I'm just getting started with Dart, so I'm using the API code from [fluent-reader-lite](https://github.com/yang991178/fluent-reader-lite/tree/master/lib/models/services) as a starting point.
